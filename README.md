# DMFVAE
Deep matrix factorization model based on variational autoencoder for miRNA-disease associations prediction

# Requirements
* TensorFlow 1.9.0
* python 3.6
* numpy 1.19.5
* pandas 0.20.0
* scikit-learn 0.24.0
* scipy 1.5.4

# Data
We provide two kinds of database includes HMDD v2.0 and HMDD v3.2

# Take HMDD v2.0 as an example：
1. modifing the corresponding location. 
2. using example.py to obtain embedding featureof miRNAs and disease network structures.  
1. using dataprocess.py to obtain samples.
2. using vae.py to train and prediction.
